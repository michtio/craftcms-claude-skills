# Changelog

## 1.2.0 -- 2026-04-14

Complete rewrite of configuration reference. Full coverage of all Craft CMS 5 config settings, mail transport, search performance, and app component configuration.

### New

- **config-general.md** — all 130+ GeneralConfig settings across 17 categories with implications, dangerous interactions, and production hardening guidance
- **config-app.md** — all app.php components: cache (DB/Redis/APCu/Memcached), session, queue, mutex, mailer (SMTP/Gmail/Sendmail + AWS SES/Mailgun/Postmark/Sendgrid plugins), search component, logging, CORS, database replicas, module registration, multi-site maxSites
- **config-bootstrap.md** — environment variables, CRAFT_* auto-mapping, aliases (@web/@webroot/custom), config priority order, fluent API, custom.php, db.php, routes.php, htmlpurifier configs
- Web vs console split explanation — why app.web.php and app.console.php exist, decision table for which components go in which file

### Changed

- **craftcms SKILL.md** — configuration reference split from 1 file to 3, with expanded task routing examples (search, mail, env vars, GraphQL tokens)
- **README** — added 4 configuration prompt examples (search performance, mail transport, production hardening, environment variables)

### Removed

- **configuration.md** — replaced by the three new config reference files

## 1.1.1 -- 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **craft-twig-guidelines**: Variable naming convention was incorrectly enforcing snake_case for multi-word Twig variables and flagging camelCase as an error. Now correctly requires camelCase (`buttonText`, `containerClass`) and flags snake_case (`button_text`, `container_class`) as wrong.
- **craft-project-setup**: Project template `templates.md` said "No camelCase" — now says multi-word uses camelCase with examples.
- **README**: Updated install instructions to include marketplace registration step.

## 1.1.0 -- 2026-04-12

Major expansion across all skills. Content modeling overhaul, 10 new reference files, new project setup skill, validation coverage, and storage architecture documentation.

### New

- **craft-project-setup** skill -- scaffolds CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/ tailored to project type (plugin, site, module, hybrid)
- **multi-site-patterns.md** -- language switchers, hreflang, 4 site architectures, cross-site queries, translations, site detection
- **plugin-vite.md** -- VitePluginService for CP asset bundles, HMR, TypeScript/Vue, DDEV dev server
- **testing.md** -- Pest + Codeception, element factories, HTTP/queue/DB assertions, mocking, console/event testing
- **headless.md** -- headlessMode, GraphQL API, CORS, preview tokens, hybrid patterns, Next.js/Nuxt/Astro
- **configuration.md** -- general.php fluent API, .env variables, app.php overrides, Redis, config priority order
- **users-and-permissions.md** -- CMS editions, user groups, addresses, permissions architecture, field layout UI elements
- **composition-patterns.md** -- split from atomic-patterns.md; molecules, organisms, structural embed, component creation
- **feed-me.md** plugin reference -- data import, field mapping, duplicate handling, CLI
- **imager-x.md** plugin reference -- batch transforms, named presets, effects, optimizers, external storage

### Changed

- **craft-content-modeling**: major rewrite
  - Accurate entrification timeline (4.4 CLI, 5.0 CP disabled, 6.0 removal) replacing incorrect "deprecated" language
  - Entry type visual identity (icon, color, description, group, uiLabelFormat)
  - Field instances: reuse fields via per-context overrides instead of creating duplicates
  - Reserved field handles: 83+ handles documented with synonym table and active check instruction
  - CKEditor vs Matrix vs Content Block decision guide
  - Asset volumes/filesystems/transforms: three-layer model, architecture decisions, subpath rules
  - Storage architecture: five-table model, JSON keyed by instance UID, nested set structures, draft reuse
  - Project config: `project-config/touch` + `craft up` workflow as hard rule
  - CMS editions, section properties (maxAuthors, previewTargets), propagation methods
- **craft-php-guidelines**: restructured from 80-line stub to full skill with 5 reference files (PHPDoc standards, class organization, naming conventions, templates/patterns, tooling)
- **craftcms/architecture.md**: added plugin editions (declaring, checking, feature gating, CMS edition requirements) and Yii2 core validators (17 validators, conditional validation, custom messages)
- **craftcms/elements.md**: added CP edit pages (getCpEditUrl, asCpScreen, propagation UI, field layout designer, preview targets)
- **craft-twig-guidelines**: `???` operator guidance softened (OK with empty-coalesce or SEOmatic installed)
- **atomic-patterns.md**: split into atoms (367 lines) and composition (382 lines)
- All 6 agents: added environment rules (DDEV-only, symlinked paths, ECS scope), skill declarations, element template planning
- All skills: companion skills system (each skill declares co-dependencies for cross-loading)

### Fixed

- `web_fetch` to `WebFetch` across 22 files (matching actual tool name)
- `#ddev-generated` pitfall and example in ddev skill (was inverted/contradictory)
- Reserved handles used in content-patterns.md examples (`icon` to `topicIcon`/`serviceIcon`, `language` to `codeLanguage`)
- Bare `php craft` command in content-modeling (now `ddev craft`)
- Stale path reference in quality.md
- Portfolio field handle mismatch (`.myFeatured()` to `.featured()`)
- Content Block return type (was "Entry", now correctly "ContentBlock")
- Matrix Twig include missing `only` keyword
- Sprig plugin reference missing from craft-site SKILL.md table
- dateModified guidance: was self-contradictory ("never edit YAML" + "edit dateModified"), now uses `project-config/touch`

## 1.0.0 -- 2026-04-09

Initial release. 6 skills, 6 agents, project template, 20 plugin references.
